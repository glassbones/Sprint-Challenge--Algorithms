## Exercise I

a) Linear O(n) 


b) Polynomial O(n^c)


c) Linear O(n)

## Exercise II

I would probably try something like a Binary search tree
if the the building has 7 floors and I go to the middle 
floor (floor 4) to throw an egg and it breaks I divide 
floors 1 - 4 in half and go there next to throw an egg
(probaly floor 3 over floor 2 :P)
if it doesnt break on floor 3 ive found my answer
if it does break on floor 3 im going to need to go down to floor 2
and try it out.

This would be a O(log n) case and maybe even close to 0(1) if i guessed right in the first 2 floors.
At worst I could see it being O(n) if it was a 3 story building and i tried to two top floors twice.
even if it was 10,000 floors I would probably pick a reasonable root.
